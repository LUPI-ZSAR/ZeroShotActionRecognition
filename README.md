# Learning Using Privileged Information for Zero-Shot Action Recognition
This is an official implementation of:

Zhiyi Gao, et al. Learning Using Privileged Information for Zero-Shot Action Recognition, ACCV, 2022. [Arxiv Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08632)

**Note**: This is a preliminary release, but feel that it would be better to first put the code out there.
